        We all know about the supply chain disruptions of the past few years and most 
        leading analysts agree challenges lie ahead. But we wanted to offer supply chain 
        leaders a quantitative read on supply chain realities: what are decision-makersâ€™ top concerns 
        and how are they preparing? What are the differences between countries and regions? How can we 
        track these shifts in priorities, and how can we spur each other on to greater supply chain 
        excellence?
